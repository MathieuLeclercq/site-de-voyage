# Site de voyage - Travel website   
This is a travel website created in our 1st year of school at CPE Lyon.   
We had to realize the *front-end* part of the website. With some json file to simulate database, in particular for the management of the various destinations and the login of the users (passwords here stored in clear, safety wasn't in the scope of this project).    
We thus set up the website in HTML5 and CSS3, and native javascript (JS frameworks not authorized for this first web project). We also had to use the *open weather map API* in order to have a first approach of web APIs.   
It was a good first experience of web development and its uses.   
*All the program and comments are in French.*
